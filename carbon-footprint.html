    <h2>3 changes you can make to reduce your carbon footprint:</h2>
        
    <h3>1. Reduce your energy use and switch to renewable energy</h3> <!-- Tips on how to reduce carbon footprint-->
        <ul>
            <li>If it is possible in your country, you can switch your home energy supply to a green energy plan or change to a 100% renewable energy provider. If you can’t
                change your home energy supplier, you could reduce your dependence on fossil fuels by installing solar panels at your home, 
                buying a solar water heater or using solar powered tech wherever you can (outdoor or portable lighting, mobile phone power banks, etc).</li><br>
            <li>Reduce energy consumption by installing only LED lights in your house and choosing energy-efficient appliances and heating and cooling solutions and reduce energy
                consumption by properly insulating your home with appropriate heat trapping or cooling materials that will reduce the amount of energy needed to warm or cool your
                home.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>2. Change the way you travel</h3> 
            <p>Walk whenever possible, or use an electric bike or scooter. Alternatively, use public transport (bus, tram, train) instead of a private car. If you have no choice
                but to use a car, think about ride-sharing instead of travelling individually. If you’re buying a new or second hand car, opt for more environmentally 
                friendly electric vehicles if you can. Restrict your flights substantially and opt for direct flights whenever possible.</p>

        <h3>3. Change how much you buy and who you buy from</h3>
        <p>Reduce your consumption overall, choose recycled products and remember to recycle things you no longer need and support companies who have strong sustainable
            values and practices.</p>
