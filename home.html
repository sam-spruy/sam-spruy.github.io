        <p>Jane Piggot - "I recently had Rolsa Technologies install solar panels at my home, and I wanted to share my experience. <!--Reviews-->
            From the initial consultation to the installation, the team was professional and friendly. They explained the whole process in simple terms, which really put my mind at ease.
            The installation day went smoothly. The crew arrived on time and worked efficiently. They took care to keep my property clean and were respectful of my space. After the installation, 
            they walked me through how everything worked and answered all my questions. Since switching to solar, I’ve noticed a significant drop in my energy bills, which is definitely a plus.
            Overall, I’m really happy with the quality of the work and the service I received from Rolsa Technologies. If you’re considering solar panels, I would recommend giving them a call!"</p>

        <p>Dave Goodall - "I recently had a chance to use Rolsa Technologies electric vehicle charging stations, and I have to say, it was a pretty good experience overall. The charging station I 
            visited was conveniently located and easy to find, which is always a plus when you’re on the road.The setup was straightforward. I pulled up, plugged in my EV, and the charging started 
            right away without any hiccups. It didn’t take long, either—I appreciated how quickly my car started charging up. The station also had a nice display that showed the charging progress, 
            so I could keep an eye on it while I grabbed a quick bite to eat nearby. One thing I really liked was the clean and well-maintained area around the charging station. It felt safe and inviting, 
            which is especially important when you’re taking a break during a long drive. Overall, I would definitely recommend Rolsa Technologies’ charging stations for anyone needing a charge on their journey. 
            They made my experience hassle-free and efficient!"</p>

        <p>Wendy McGee - "I recently had a consultation with an agent from Rolsa Technologies, and I must say, it was a pretty good experience. From the moment I reached out, the communication was clear and professional. 
            The agent took the time to listen to my concerns and really understood what I needed. During our conversation, they explained the different options available without overwhelming me with jargon. I appreciated 
            how they simplified things, making it easy for me to follow along. It felt like they genuinely wanted to help, rather than just pushing a sale. What stood out the most was their patience. I had a lot of questions, 
            and they answered every single one thoroughly. I left the consultation feeling more informed and confident about my next steps. Overall, I would recommend Rolsa Technologies if you're looking for a company that 
            provides solid support and guidance."</p>
