            <h1>Solar Panels</h1>
            
            <p>Solar Panels are instruments that take the energy from the sun and convert it into electrical energy, which we can use.</p>
            <p>Each panel can produce around 430W on sunny days and a typical system consists of 12 panels working together. So you can imagine <!--What solar panels are-->
            the amount of electricity solar panels can generate on a given day.</p>
            <p>We offer customers a 10% discount on our solar panels which is great value considering the price of solar panels today, when a typical solar panel costs Â£500.</p>
        
            <p>How it works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We carry out a roof survey, to see if it is stable enough to hold solar panels.</li>
                <li>We measure your roof accurately for the dimensions of the solar panels.</li>
                <li>Create a digital version so you can see what the solar panel will look like when completed.</li> <!--Explaining our process of solar panel installations-->
                <li>Our team will work on the roof and make sure it is of a high standard. Quality over quantity.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Smart Home Energy Management Systems (EMS)</h1>
        
            <p>Smart homes are the future of technology. They use technological devices to ensure your home is up to your standards and how you want it to be.</p>
            <p>In the UK, smart homes are experiencing unpredecented growth. Around 7.2 million households (24%) are already smart homes and projections indicate
                around 50% of UK households will use smart devices in homes by 2027.</p>
            <p>The most popular devices in the home are voice-activated assistants (Amazon Alexa) found in 54% of homes. Another popular one are security cameras. Security systems
                have risen 20% just in 2023, as more people protect their property with surveillance and alarm systems.</p>
            
                <p>The benefits of smart homes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your life easier and convenient as you don't have to do manual chores.</li>
                <li>Smart homes can help your house become energy efficient as it can analyse and adjust overconsumption.</li>
                <li>You can manage your house remotely through smartphone or tablet. If you are at work or in the car, you can set the technology to check on pets
                        or adjust the temperature.</li> <!-- Benefits of smart homes-->

            <h1>Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations</h1>
                <p>Electric vehicle charging stations are places where electric vehicles go and recharge their batteries. They supply electricity to the car through chargers.</p>
                <p>There are different types of chargers: Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Level 1 - These are standard chargers which take the most to charge up, more than 24 hours for a full battery.</li> <!--Explaining what EV Charging stations are-->
                    <li>Level 2 - Uses 240V and found in most public EV stations, taking around a few hours to charge.</li>
                    <li>Level 3 - Supplies car with a full battery charging under an hour.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are various public charging stations located around the UK, but are there any near you? This is where we come in.</p>
                <p>We offer different tiers of charging stations: Home, Business and Public.</p>
                <p>The Home tier is for personal use and gets installed in the garage or driveway for convenience. It saves time and money as you are charging at home instead of paying money
                    to charge at a gas station.</p> <!-- Explaining to user what tiers are there for Electric vehicle charging stations -->
                <p>Business tier: This tier is for companies who want EV charging stations for their employees. It keeps employees happy because they don't have to travel far to
                    charge their car, they can just charge at the workplace. Also, the station provides businesses with an extra income stream as employees and other people nearby pay for usage.</p>
                <p>Public tier: For public use in shopping malls, car parks etc. This means people can charge their cars while they're out and about shopping or at a football game, which gives them ease of mind as 
                    it is constantly charging when they are away.</p>
